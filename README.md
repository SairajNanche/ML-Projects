A linear regression model capable of predicting housing prices with reasonable accuracy. The 
model's performance will be evaluated based on the chosen metrics, and it will be fine-tuned 
to achieve the best possible results. Additionally, a simple UI will be developed to 
demonstrate the model's predictions in a user-friendly manner.
This project will provide a practical application of linear regression in predicting housing 
prices, demonstrating the process from data preprocessing to model deployment. The insights 
gained from this project can be extended to more complex models and other real-world 
applications in the field of machine learning
